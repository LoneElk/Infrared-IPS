## Prototype Infrared Positioning System using MLX90620 Thermopile Array

**Based on my Msc Thesis 2014**

The aim of this project is to explore the criteria an Indoor Positioning System would need to meet in order to support a Telecare package, and then to develop a prototype Indoor Positioning System suitable for assisting the elderly to remain in their homes.
To achieve this aim a survey of available indoor location techniques and technologies has been completed, along with a review of the requirements and constraints that are specific to tracking users within the home.

The information collected has been used to shape the development of a prototype which addresses all the challenges of this task. 
A small number of interviews have been completed with Health Care professionals to explore unique requirements and constraints applicable to this domain, and the insights gained during these interviews have been used to shape the design of the indoor application.

## Overview of Code Structure

## Hardware Used

- MLX90620 Thermopile Array
- Arduino Uno
- JYMCU Bluetooth Unit

The Indoor Positioning System was written in Python using the opencv libaries for image processing.

## [Thesis](https://github.com/tS7hKamAYL84j91/Infrared-IPS/blob/master/FPR_brownjames_09213656_v1.pdf)

The thesis explains much of the theory behind the code and provides and overview of the class models and software patterns employed.
